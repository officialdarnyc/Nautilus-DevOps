# Difference between a DevOps Engineer and SRE Engineer

**DevOps** is a set of practices that aims to shorten the software development lifecycle and speed the delivery of higher-quality software by breaking down the silos 
and combining and automating the work of software development teams and IT operations teams.

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** uses software engineering to automate IT operations tasks that would normally be performed by system administrators. 
These tasks include production system management, change management and incident response.

SRE and DevOps are two sides of the same coin with a shared purpose - to break down organizational barriers to deliver better software, faster.
However, there are a few differences between both of them.

## Development and implementation ##

DevOps is about core development. SRE is about implementing the core. What does that mean? Let’s think about it this way.

DevOps teams are focused on core development. They are working on a product or application that is the solution to someone’s problem. 
They are taking an agile approach to software development that helps them build, test, deploy and monitor applications with speed, quality and control.

SREs are working on the implementation of the core. They are constantly giving feedback back into that core development group to say 
"Hey, something that you guys have designed isn't working exactly the way that you think that it is." 
SRE leverages operations data and software engineering to automate IT operations tasks and accelerate software delivery, while minimizing IT risk.

## Automation ##

DevOps is going to automate deployment. They’re going to automate tasks and features. SRE is going to automate redundancy, and they're going to automate 
manual tasks that they can turn into programmatic tasks to keep the stack up and running.

## Skill Sets ##

DevOps are more into the Core development. They take the written code, test it and pushing it out into production to get 
an application line to help solve a problem.

SREs are more investigative. They are willing to do the analysis to find why something has gone wrong. They want to ensure that the same problems don’t keep happening.
They want to be proactive in their efforts, not reactive. They want to automate repetitive tasks so they can innovate.
