# DevOps Best Practices

## 1. Build a collaborative culture ##

The whole point of DevOps is to improve collaboration and eliminate silos between development, operations, 
and quality assurance teams. This way, the software can be developed and shipped to customers faster. 
Achieving this level of collaboration requires a change in the culture and mindset of the entire engineering team as well as a common goal or set of goals.

Both developers and operations engineers have to take full ownership of the software development process and work together to meet customer expectations.

## 2. Put customer satisfaction first ##

Whether you’re using the classic waterfall model or a full DevOps approach, the goal is to meet customer expectations.
Understanding your customers in their context is key to a successful DevOps approach.

## 3. Agile project management ##

Agile is an iterative project management approach that helps software engineering teams execute higher-quality projects faster.
By combining DevOps with an agile approach, you can release a small piece of functionality, see customers' feedback and pivot as necessary. 
Instead of spending two quarters to fully develop a feature that ultimately misses the mark, you can iterate on it along the way.

The agile principle of small, iterative pieces of development ties in well with the DevOps approach because it results in even faster deployment.

## 4. Shift Left with Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) ##

Continuous integration (CI) is a core DevOps best practice that is used for integrating code changes from different contributors into a central repository.
When teams “shift left”, they bring testing into their code development processes early. 
Instead of sending multiple changes to a separate test or QA team, 
a variety of tests are performed throughout the coding process so that developers can fix bugs or improve code quality while they work on the relevant section of the codebase.

## 5. Build with the right tools ##

A DevOps toolchain requires the right tools for each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, with key capabilities to improve software quality and speed of delivery.

## 6. Monitor the right metrics ##

Continuous performance monitoring is a DevOps best practice. The effectiveness of a DevOps approach can only be measured by tracking the right performance metrics, 
such as lead time, mean time to detect, and issue severity.
Monitoring unit cost as a DevOps metric is a good practice because it helps you build cost-optimized software from the get-go.

## 7. Switch to microservices ##

Microservices architecture is the approach of building a single application as a set of small services.
In a microservices architecture, smaller applications are deployed as independent services which are tied together through an application programming interface (API).
Microservices fits into the DevOps approach of breaking large, complex projects into smaller pieces. Different services can be worked on independently without 
affecting the entire system.

Microservices also support other DevOps practices such as continuous integration and delivery, ensuring speedy and steady deployment.
