# Deploy an app via nginx and install SSL

Deployed a node.js application called Rocket.Chat using docker compose. Rocket.Chat is an open-source fully customizable communications platform.
On a Linux VM hosted in Azure, installed docker and docker compose. Created a docker-compose.yaml file and added the below:

```
version: '2'

          echo \"Tried $$i times. Waiting 5 secs...\";
          sleep 5;
        done; (exit $$s)"

```
Started the stack of services by running:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
This started:
- a MongoDB service named `mongo`.
- a service named `mongo-init-replica` that waited for mongo to be ready, connected to it, initialized it and terminated itself (mongo kept running).
- a service `rocketchat`, that also waited for `mongo` to be ready, the `mongo-init-replica` to initialize, and then ran the Rocket.Chat app.

Pointed my subdomain `chat.blutech.tk` to the public IP address of my Linux VM by creating an A record in my DNS records.

Installed nginx web server and confirmed the service was running with the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install nginx
systemctl status nginx.service
```
To begin setting up nginx as my reverse proxy server in order to serve HTTPS, ran the below commands that installed certbot tool so as to use Let's Encrypt SSL:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
```
Using the certbot tool, obtained SSL certificate for my subdomain using the command:

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d chat.blutech.tk
```
Copied over my domain's certificate key obtained from let's encrypt to my nginx folder with the command:

```
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.blutech.tk/privkey.pem /etc/nginx/certificate.key
```

Set the permission lock for the certificate key file:

```
sudo chmod 400 /etc/nginx/certificate.key
```

Copied over my domain's full certificate chain to the same nginx folder:

```
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.blutech.tk/fullchain.pem /etc/nginx/certificate.crt
```
Edited the default file for the nginx configuration to provide a secure reverse proxy for my Rocket.Chat server app with the following config:

```
# Upstream definition
upstream backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
}
# http to https redirection
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name chat.blutech.tk;
  rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;
}
# HTTPS Server
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name chat.blutech.tk;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/rocketchat.access.log;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certificate.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # donâ€™t use SSLv3 ref: POODLE
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forward-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forward-Proto http;
        proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```
Restarted the nginx service and then, confirmed it was running fine.

```
sudo service nginx restart
sudo service nginx status
```

Confirmed that the server app was reachable on the domain [chat.blutech.tk](https://chat.blutech.tk/), and the SSL was correctly and successfully installed.
