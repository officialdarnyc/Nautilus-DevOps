# OSI Model
## What is the OSI Model?

The open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It’s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

If you need to memorize the layers for a college or certification test, here are a few sentences to help remember them in order. The first letter of each word is the same as the first letter an OSI layer.

### From Application to Physical (Layer 7 to Layer 1): 

- All People Seem To Need Data Processing
- All Pros Search Top Notch Donut Places
- A Penguin Said That Nobody Drinks Pepsi
- A Priest Saw Two Nuns Doing Pushups

### From Physical to Application (Layer 1 to Layer 7):

- Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
- Pew! Dead Ninja Turtles Smell Particularly Awful
- People Don’t Need To See Paula Abdul
- Pete Doesn’t Need To Sell Pickles Anymore
