# Understanding of a DevOps Culture in an Organization

Agile software development has broken down some of the silos between requirements analysis, testing and development.
Deployment, operations and maintenance are other activities which have suffered a similar separation from the rest of the software development process.
The DevOps movement is aimed at removing these silos and encouraging collaboration between development and operations.

The very term DevOps—a portmanteau of development and operations—speaks to its goal of tearing down the walls separating two groups that (hopefully) share a common goal.
DevOps is all about replacing the inefficiencies and errors associated with manual process,
allowing developers and IT folks to focus on innovation and creating value for the organization,
instead of getting bogged down in routine maintenance.

The “three pillars” of a successful DevOps venture: culture, automation, and measurement. Other pillars of DevOps depend upon a healthy DevOps culture—even as they help to support and sustain that culture. Automating software development and deployment tasks and workflows is a key pillar of DevOps success.

The primary characteristic of DevOps culture is increased collaboration between the roles of development and operations. There are some important cultural shifts, within teams and at an organizational level, that support this collaboration.

Measurement is far more than just another item to check off your DevOps list, it's a critical pillar of any successful DevOps journey.
It’s hard to imagine succeeding with DevOps without a firm grasp of how and why to monitor the performance, productivity, and outcomes of your software development projects.

Three stages of measuring DevOps success: 1) Preparing your DevOps team, 2) Activating well-defined processes, and 3) Optimizing your team, process, and enterprise. Each guide focuses on identifying key performance metrics and delivering the best possible digital experience for your customers.
Automation in the DevOps philosophy is about making faster tasks in order to interface things and create automated pipelines. Almost everything could be done manually, but in order to focus on product development and to create continuous pipelines (continuous integration, delivery, testing, deployment ..etc.) and feedback loops, everything starts with automation:
	Automate infrastructure
	Automate integration
	Automate delivery
	Automate feedbacks
	Automate scalability
	Automate bugs hunting
The continuous processes rely on already automated tasks.
There are four steps for organizations just getting started planning their DevOps automation process. It’s pretty straightforward:

1) Evaluate your needs,

2) Identify your bottlenecks,

3) Consider the ROI, and

4) Continuously assess and reevaluate. The end result: “continuous monitoring and improving”.
