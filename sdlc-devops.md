# Describe the Software development Life Cycle identifying where DevOps fit in

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the software development world’s spellcheck. 
The SDLC process involves several distinct stages, including planning, analysis, design, building, testing, deployment and maintenance.
There are currently 6 SDLC models, they are: Agile, Lean, Waterfall, Iterative, Spiral, and DevOps.

The **DevOps methodology** is a relative newcomer to the SDLC scene. 
It emerged from two trends: the application of Agile and Lean practices to operations work, and the general shift in business toward seeing the value of collaboration 
between development and operations staff at all stages of the SDLC process.

In a DevOps model, Developers and Operations teams work together closely — and sometimes as one team — to accelerate innovation and the deployment of higher-quality 
and more reliable software products and functionalities. Updates to products are small but frequent. Discipline, continuous feedback and process improvement, 
and automation of manual development processes are all hallmarks of the DevOps model.

Amazon Web Services describes DevOps as the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, 
and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity, 
evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development 
and infrastructure management processes. So like many SDLC models, DevOps is not only an approach to planning and executing work, 
but also a philosophy that demands a nontraditional mindset in an organization.
